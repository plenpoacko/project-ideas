In Xenus 2: White Gold, you play as Saul Myers, a retired veteran of a special military squad that fought in the Caribbean region. You are hired by the government to investigate a series of mysterious events connected to a new drug that is killing young people in Europe and America. The drug is indistinguishable from cocaine, but it has an incredibly high mortality rate. You arrive on one of the Caribbean islands, where you start your investigation. But soon you find yourself in the middle of a socially unstable and politically volatile environment, with 7 different factions including Civilians, Government, Mafia, Guerrillas, Bandits, Natives and CIA operatives. You will have to deal with them all, while uncovering the truth behind the drug and its origins.
